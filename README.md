## Overview

Credit card fraud detection is a significant challenge in the financial sector. This project demonstrates how to process, analyze, and model data to identify fraudulent transactions using Python and machine learning frameworks. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and imported directly into the environment using the Kaggle API.

## Project Summary

The aim of this project is to develop an efficient machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Fraudulent activities in credit card usage can lead to significant financial losses, making this a critical application of data science.

### Key Highlights:

- **Dataset**: A real-world dataset containing anonymized transaction details, including whether each transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visual and statistical analysis to identify patterns and anomalies in the dataset.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Since fraud cases are rare, techniques like oversampling and undersampling are applied to balance the data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes CNN, decision trees, random forests, boosting techniques such as XGBoost, and an ensemble model using a Voting Classifier.
  - The Voting Classifier combines the predictions of multiple models (e.g., CNN, random forests, and XGBoost) to improve overall performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Models are evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to ensure effective fraud detection.

## Features

- **Environment Setup**: Automatically installs required libraries such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and XGBoost.
- **Dataset Import**: Demonstrates how to use the Kaggle API to fetch datasets directly into a Colab environment.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes visualizations and statistics to understand the data.
- **Model Training**: Implements machine learning models, including handling imbalanced datasets.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Utilizes a Voting Classifier to integrate predictions from multiple models for better accuracy.
- **Evaluation**: Measures performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
